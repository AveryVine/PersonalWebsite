Back in July 2019, I was interviewed for an article in Carleton University’s Eureka! magazine, which was preparing to feature a collection of students from the Faculty of Science who exemplified experiential learning. In October, the magazine finally came out.<!--more-->

Yesterday, the university uploaded a feature story containing three of us students to their home page. In fact, when you go to [Carleton University’s home page](https://carleton.ca) right now, the first thing you see is me! I’m extremely humbled to be featured alongside these other incredible students, and I feel very fortunate for the opportunities I’ve had. Fingers crossed for many more years of amazing things to come!
