                    <p>Hi, my name is Avery! I'm a developer based in Ottawa, Ontario, studying Computer Science
                        (Mobile Development stream) at Carleton University and currently working at TripAdvisor. I am a
                        focused, goal-driven individual who consistently brings enthusiasm and a high standard of
                        professionalism to the workplace, both in independent and team environments. I have a wide
                        range of experience in many areas of programming, and I enjoy playing the piano and video games
                        in my spare time. With significant work experience across multiple disciplines and several
                        personal and university projects completed, I am ready to take on new and exciting challenges.</p>

                    <p>TripAdvisor is the largest travel site in the world, packed with user reviews about hotels,
                        restaurants, and attractions across every continent. As a member of the Restaurants B2C
                        (business-to-consumer) team, I'm responsible for working on some of the user-facing
                        restaurants-related features, bug fixes, and improvements. More specifically, I'm working on
                        the TripAdvisor iOS application.</p>
                    <p>While I'm here, I'm getting the opportunity to build upon my existing skills as an iOS
                        developer, working with experienced colleagues to ensure I'm learning and using best practices
                        and writing strong, clear, and reusable Swift code. Among other things, I'll spend a
                        significant portion of my time working on further advancing the new Nearby Restaurants map/list
                        combo view that launched just after I started.</p>

                    <p>Turns out I actually worked for TripAdvisor during two different co-op terms! This was the first
                        time I worked for them, before they offered me the opportunity to work at their headquarters in
                        Needham, MA. As a member of the Restaurants B2B (business-to-business) team, I worked to
                        develop software that restaurants can use to improve their listings on TripAdvisor - anything
                        from on-site ads to animated slideshows of pictures to a multitude of other features.</p>
                    <p>During my time at TripAdvisor Canada, the company launched an API to allow advertisement
                        agencies to manage ads for their clients (restaurant owners with many locations). This project
                        marked my first contribution to a significant coding project at a company, and it gave me the
                        chance to put my expertise in Java to the test.</p>

                    <p>TravelClick is a company that specializes in solutions for the hospitality industry. The Ottawa
                        office worked with the Guest Management Solutions (GMS) product, which sent out guest
                        confirmation emails, allowed hotels to conduct surveys, and much more.</p>
                    <p>TravelClick was my first co-op position. I worked as an Integration Specialist - my job was to
                        connect hotels with our databases by installing the GMS software on their servers. I monitered
                        data feeds, wrote extensive documentation, fixed elusive bugs, and completed several
                        significant code changes, all while ensuring clients were satisfied with our service.</p>

                    <p>During the summer of 2016, I volunteered to complete some research with a Computer Science
                        professor at Carleton University, Dr. Doron Nussbaum. At the time, he was researching
                        algorithms to find the shortest path to a moving target. The position began as volunteer work,
                        but he was able to secure a grant for the project, allowing me to work full-time.</p>
                    <p>My time working under Dr. Nussbaum was very useful, as I was able to learn many programming
                        best-practices, develop my critical thinking skills, work on the clarity and conciseness of the
                        documentation I wrote.</p>

                        <p>As a mentor at the Carleton Science Student Success Centre (SSSC) and a member of the
                            Computer Science team, one of my tasks was to develop a mobile application for the centre.
                            The app, compatible with both iPhones and iPads, displays all of the centre's upcoming
                            events (with optional pre-event notifications), provides students with quick access to the
                            centre's Resources page, and offers a full-fledged assignment tracker and grade calculator.</p>
                        <p>There are two components: a mobile front-end that displays information to the user, and a
                            Node.js server that provides an API that the app can use to retrieve event-related
                            information. With the iOS application complete, the rest of the Computer Science team is
                            working on an Android counterpart, with a 2019 planned release.</p>

                    <span class="project-description">
                        <p>As the final project in my Intelligent Web-based Information Systems course, we were given
                            the freedom to explore a project topic of our choosing, as long as it integrated the course
                            contents. My friend and I built Wing It, a web application that can determine the political
                            leaning of a given news article through content analysis. In addition, the application
                            recommends articles concerning similar topics from left wing, centrist, and right wing news
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>We used a range of technologies and algorithms to complete this project including Jersey,
                            MongoDB, crawler4j, Naive Bayes analysis, and more. In the future, we hope to continue to
                            improve this project by implementing features ranging from unsupervised learning for
                            training purposes to better contextual recommendation.</p>

                        <p>I first developed my website in January of 2017, in preparation for my first co-op job
                            search. I had just completed my web development class, so with that fresh motivation I
                            taught myself to use the w3.css framework, enabling quick and easy development.</p>
                        <p>Looking back in November 2017, I realized that my website looked a degree amateur-ish, so I
                            decided to revamp my it using my newly-acquired understanding of Bootstrap 4 - creating a
                            responsive, modern website that can properly represent me as a developer.</p>

                        <p>I first began developing this application when a friend came to me, requesting that I make

                            realized that this had the potential to become a full-fledged app, so I pursued development
                            beyond just the basic stages.</p>
                        <p>I eventually completed the app in June of 2016, however I was unable to submit it to the App
                            Store due to developer age restrictions. After a short wait, I paid the developer feeds and
                            completed the submission process.
