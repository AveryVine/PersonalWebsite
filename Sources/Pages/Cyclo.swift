                Text("Cyclo is an endless sidescrolling game, where your one and only goal is to dodge the incoming blocks. But there's a twist: you can't move your character up and down! Instead, you must harness the power of rotation to swerve between obstacles. There is a unique trait to the incoming blocks: they never come in pairs. This means, with careful timing, you can swap your direction of rotation and swerve right between them! But watch out! At various points throughout the game, it will become more difficult to survive. Watch out for things like your character moving up and down, blocks increasing speed, or even blocks switching to different heights at the last second!")
