## ðŸŽ¤ Is This Thing On?

Hello! I haven't touched my blog inâ€¦ well, over four years, according to my last post. In fact, my blog was actually completely broken for a couple of years, and I didn't even realize it! But recently I decided to redo my website (mostly because of my interest in Paul Hudson's [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite) static site generator), which gave me the opportunity to give everything a new coat of paint, including this blog. Additionally, with [Mastodon 4.3](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/10/mastodon-4.3/) adding support for author attribution, I thought it might be an interesting opportunity to explore Fediverse integration.<!--more--> Of course, testing author attribution requires linking one of my blog posts on Mastodon, and I *definitely* don't want to link to one of my old posts (although they're all there, if you care about my international travels in 2019 among other things). So, now I've posted again!

### Does this mean you'll be posting more frequently?

Unlikely? I don't think I have very many insightful things to say, in all honesty. I'm much more of a passive consumer of blogs, media, and the Fediverse, and don't see that changing just because I brushed off the ol' blog. But I suppose this post breaks a 4.5-year streak of not posting, so maybe this does mean something. Who knows.

In the meantime, enjoy this picture that I took in Toronto's Graffiti Alley a couple of weeks ago.
