## Japan - Land of the Rising Sun

Iâ€™d always wanted to visit Japan. It has a certain cultural appeal to me, one that is just so different from any other country in the world. Unfortunately, living in North America makes it difficult to even _get_ to the other side of the world, a problem that is compounded as a student with expenses. But after getting extremely fortunate with my working opportunities (i.e. [TripAdvisor](/post/a-new-chapter)), in combination with some lucky timing, I ended up with the means and the time to take a whole six weeks to travel the world! So naturally, Japan was first up on my list.
