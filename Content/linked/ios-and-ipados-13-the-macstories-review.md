## iOS and iPadOS 13 - The MacStories Review

Every September, Federico Viticci from MacStories publishes a wonderful review and in-depth analysis of Apple’s latest version of iOS. This year he has not only done it again, but it artfully encompasses both the traditional iOS *and* the brand new iPadOS.<!--more--> Federico is an incredibly insightful person when it comes to Apple products, and has very good understanding of many developer concepts despite not truly being one himself, so I’d highly recommend kicking back, getting a coffee, and giving this a nice long read!
